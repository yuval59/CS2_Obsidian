# What?
You can play songs on the bells at T spawn
## The system
The bells are numbered left to right, and there are five of them.
So, 5 1 3 means the right most bell, then the left most best, then the middle.

`space` means normal pause between notes
`-` means shorter pause between notes
`_` means longer pause between notes
