# What?
This is for misc. notes, meant to be written here every so often about specific areas I struggle in, things I want to improve, specific goals, and just some thoughts about how things are going.
### 11/7/2024
- Started streaming this as a sort of "challenge"
- Sens feeling pretty good, but still adjusting
## 12/7/2024
- Bit of an off day today, streamed a little, played deathmatch, added a bunch of Mirage smokes (they're pretty easy tbh)
- My aim feels worse than yesterday, having some trouble adjusting to the lower eDPI (960 -> 640)
- Much like the video's advice, I did make this whole Obsidian vault tho, because I do think making this from scratch myself is gonna be more effective and I much prefer Obsidian over Google Docs for this usecase
- `Couple hours later` I played some more games and my aim feels weird, I started the game playing like complete and utter ass, and by the end I was headshotting people left and right. I think it's getting better, guess we'll see.
