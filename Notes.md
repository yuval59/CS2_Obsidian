# What?
This is for misc. notes, meant to be written here every so often about specific areas I struggle in, things I want to improve, specific goals, and just some thoughts about how things are going.
### 11/7/2024
- Started streaming this as a sort of "challenge"
- Sens feeling pretty good, but still adjusting
## 12/7/2024
- Bit of an off day today, streamed a little, played deathmatch, added a bunch of Mirage smokes (they're pretty easy tbh)
- My aim feels worse than yesterday, having some trouble adjusting to the lower eDPI (960 -> 640)
- Much like the video's advice, I did make this whole Obsidian vault tho, because I do think making this from scratch myself is gonna be more effective and I much prefer Obsidian over Google Docs for this usecase
- `Couple hours later` I played some more games and my aim feels weird, I started the game playing like complete and utter ass, and by the end I was headshotting people left and right. I think it's getting better, guess we'll see.
## 13/7/2024
- I changed the aim warm-up routine a little, and I don't know whether it's this or just because I'm starting to adjust to the new sensitivity, but my aim has been pretty good
- On a less good note, my teammates seem genuinely awful and I'm finding it difficult to keep calm and keep the round together when the team's just going random places and dying, particularly on CT side. I think I need to start calling strats when we start losing to get us back into the groove maybe. When the whole team is just silent and we're losing round after round the game becomes very difficult.
- Also, I added a lot of Inferno smokes to the lineups
- I played Ancient, which has no lineups yet. I should probably add those.
- One thing to note here, I have a lot of T-sided smokes but literally 0 lineups for the CT-side - including retake utility. I'll try to improve on that this week.

- I think I'm gonna try and update my lineups with CT-sided stuff next, before adding new maps. At the very least, some retake utility.
## 14/7/2024
- I've been busy with many real-life things, so no stream or really any amount of CS today.
- To keep up the daily grind, I practiced my aim quite extensively - I've started using aim_treeni (which is very good). Did several time-challenges, using moving targets, stationary, cross-mode, insane-mode, hit 1000 targets in level 2 using size 3, and finished it with a 50 time trial on a scar (to practice awp aim without reloading) using cross mode.
- I've spent well over 30 minutes just on that, and I've hit several thousand targets during this time, so I feel like that's almost compensation enough for not playing today.
- I also practiced my lineups, and made sure I know all of them.
