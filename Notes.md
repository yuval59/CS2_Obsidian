# What?
This is for misc. notes, meant to be written here every so often about specific areas I struggle in, things I want to improve, specific goals, and just some thoughts about how things are going.
### 11/7/2024
- Started streaming this as a sort of "challenge"
- Sens feeling pretty good, but still adjusting
## 12/7/2024
- Bit of an off day today, streamed a little, played deathmatch, added a bunch of Mirage smokes (they're pretty easy tbh)
- My aim feels worse than yesterday, having some trouble adjusting to the lower eDPI (960 -> 640)
- Much like the video's advice, I did make this whole Obsidian vault tho, because I do think making this from scratch myself is gonna be more effective and I much prefer Obsidian over Google Docs for this usecase
- `Couple hours later` I played some more games and my aim feels weird, I started the game playing like complete and utter ass, and by the end I was headshotting people left and right. I think it's getting better, guess we'll see.
## 13/7/2024
- I changed the aim warm-up routine a little, and I don't know whether it's this or just because I'm starting to adjust to the new sensitivity, but my aim has been pretty good
- On a less good note, my teammates seem genuinely awful and I'm finding it difficult to keep calm and keep the round together when the team's just going random places and dying, particularly on CT side. I think I need to start calling strats when we start losing to get us back into the groove maybe. When the whole team is just silent and we're losing round after round the game becomes very difficult.
- Also, I added a lot of Inferno smokes to the lineups
- I played Ancient, which has no lineups yet. I should probably add those.
- One thing to note here, I have a lot of T-sided smokes but literally 0 lineups for the CT-side - including retake utility. I'll try to improve on that this week.

- I think I'm gonna try and update my lineups with CT-sided stuff next, before adding new maps. At the very least, some retake utility.
## 14/7/2024
- I've been busy with many real-life things, so no stream or really any amount of CS today.
- To keep up the daily grind, I practiced my aim quite extensively - I've started using aim_treeni (which is very good). Did several time-challenges, using moving targets, stationary, cross-mode, insane-mode, hit 1000 targets in level 2 using size 3, and finished it with a 50 time trial on a scar (to practice AWP aim without reloading) using cross mode.
- I've spent well over 30 minutes just on that, and I've hit several thousand targets during this time, so I feel like that's almost compensation enough for not playing today.
- I also practiced my lineups, and made sure I know all of them.
## 18/7/2024
- I've been sick since the 14th, so I haven't been keeping up with streams or notes, but I have kept grinding.
- I haven't played Premier, but I've played comps and I've done lineups and aim training.
- I added recoil training yesterday, and I feel it helps a lot
- I've been feeling pretty good in-game for the past couple days, I think this is helping quite a bit. I've top-fragged or at least middle-fragged pretty consistently. I think the lineups are helping quite a lot in-game too, just knowing I can smoke whatever I want and knowing spots and such is very useful
## 25/7/2024
- I've just finished playing for like, 7 hours straight. I just joined games and whenever I found someone who was decent or fun to play with I just added him and we kept going, slowly amassing 4 players this way.
- Some of them good, some less, but I mainly concentrated on the vibes.
- I've top-fragged with a 2+ K/D for 5 or 6 games in a row, absolutely demolishing the competition. 
- When we started losing (We had 3 games with _really_ unfortunate teammates) this obviously slowed down, but I still top-fragged, maintaining positive K/D the whole way through.
- I feel like I improved a whole lot from doing this, but I need to keep going.
- My teammates complimented my calling skills and said that it helped them, which means I'm finally getting better on that front as well!
## 27/7/2024
- Yesterday was the first day during which I did not play or do anything since the beginning of this challenge, because my sleeping schedule was so messed up I was just tired. Over two weeks without missing a day? I'll take it!
- I'd like to re-organize my lineups by where they land instead of where they are thrown from, so I could add many more variations of the same smokes. `I haven't done this yet`
