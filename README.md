# What is this repo?
This repo was made as a backup/shareable storage for my CS2 improvement files.
I will be adding more lineups and tips later, as this is very much a work-in-progress kind of deal.

I got the idea for this from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZN_QhSoHA20), link to his "CS2 Nerd Document" [here](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbHBGMGNOckItWVdLcnk1V0VSRHRJc2J5VWwyQXxBQ3Jtc0tuX1JfbERnSy1NV1J0NzYxNGVsZ3JKM2FXRVlOWEZKT3ZNR2l5TlJOSDBOT2RvOWhwLTJueDhtWjhwTUU0bTlIQ19IVEFNZDNsNmg4Y1Rka052MXBzZlFCZ1VjS0g1b1h4S2NfVHh0a3RHbUh4Ullqaw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2Fd%2F1nNUEF7E__xGHUxSVQyUobW8Kv2qT-XwxW38My238pmY%2Fcopy%3Fusp%3Dsharing)
